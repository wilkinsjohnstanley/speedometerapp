Great idea! A Speedometer app with a Java backend and a TypeScript frontend can be a very impressive project — especially if it tracks trips, shows analytics, and includes geolocation. Here’s a strong, modern tech stack for such a project, including extras that make it job-ready:
✅ Core Tech Stack
🔙 Backend (Java)

    Framework: Spring Boot

    Data access: Spring Data JPA

    Security: Spring Security + JWT for login/signup

    Database: PostgreSQL or MongoDB (for location/time-series data)

    Testing: JUnit, Mockito, Testcontainers (for integration tests)

    Build: Maven or Gradle

🌐 Frontend (TypeScript)

    Framework: React (with Vite or Next.js if SSR is needed)

    UI Library: Tailwind CSS, Material UI, or ShadCN

    State Management: Redux Toolkit or React Query

    Routing: React Router

    Mapping: Mapbox GL JS or Leaflet for trip visualization

🧠 Extra Functionality (for job-readiness)
📡 Data Gathering / Device Integration

    Use Web Bluetooth or GPS (Geolocation API) to simulate real-world data.

    Or, build a mobile companion app in Kotlin (optional) that sends speed/location to backend.

🛰️ Backend Features

    Save and fetch trip logs (timestamp, speed, location).

    Calculate and store:

        Top speed

        Avg speed

        Distance traveled

        Duration

    REST API for trip history, stats, and summaries

📊 Frontend Features

    Real-time speed display

    Route mapping with trip lines and color-coded speed indicators

    Dashboard for historical trips and performance

    Download CSV or PDF summaries

☁️ Deployment & DevOps

    Docker: Dockerize backend and frontend

    API Docs: Springdoc OpenAPI for Swagger UI

    CI/CD: GitHub Actions (build + test on push)

    Deployment:

        Render, Railway, or Fly.io for backend

        Vercel or Netlify for frontend

    Database Hosting: Supabase, Neon, or ElephantSQL

🔐 Optional Advanced Features

    OAuth login (Google/GitHub)

    Progressive Web App (PWA) support

    GraphQL instead of REST (with Spring for GraphQL)

    Kafka or RabbitMQ for trip event streaming (for extra backend complexity)

    Caching: Redis for hot data (e.g., recent trip)
